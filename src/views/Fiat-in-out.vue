          Decentralized escrow is possible only in crypto and you first need to convert your fiat money (such as USD, EUR) to cryptocurrencies. We recommend using stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies in order to protect against volatility common for other cryptocurrencies. One popular stablecoin is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDC</a>, which is supported by Coinbase and pegged to USD.

          To convert your fiat to USDC or other cryptocurrencies, use any cryptocurrency exchange. Depending on your jurisdiction, different exchanges might be available to you. Popular choices are Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Bittrex, and many others.

        <div class="col-lg-9 f-18 mt-4 color-2">
          After obtaining USDC, transfer the coins to your <a href="https://obyte.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obyte wallet</a> using <a href="https://getmein.ooo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Me In</a> or <a href="https://counterstake.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Counterstake Bridge</a>.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-9 f-18 mt-4 color-2">
          You'll also need a small (under $1 worth) amount of Bytes to send transactions on Obyte, even if you are seller. You can acquire them on <a href="https://getmein.ooo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Me In</a> or <a href="https://global.bittrex.com/trade/gbyte-btc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bittrex</a>.

        <div class="col-lg-9 f-18 mt-2 color-2">
          If you are a seller and have received stablecoins from a smart contract, you need to do the reverse operations to get fiat money: transfer the coins from Obyte to Ethereum using <a href="https://counterstake.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Counterstake Bridge</a>, then sell them for fiat on any cryptocurrency exchange, and withdraw fiat to your bank account.

        <div class="col-lg-9 f-18 mt-4 color-2">
          If you are both a buyer and a seller in different contracts (with suppliers and customers), you don't need to go to fiat all too often and can save on conversion costs.
